## 🚀 How to Use the Prompts

### Step 1: Clone the Repository Locally

Open Claude Code and tell it:
```
Clone the GitHub repository https://github.com/swiftautomators/furniture-assembly-fort-smith to my local machine.
```

### Step 2: Execute Prompts in Order

Open the `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md` file in this repository. You will see 9 numbered prompts organized by phase.

**Important:** Execute the prompts **in exact order**, one at a time. Do not skip ahead.

For each prompt:
1. **Copy the entire prompt text** from the markdown file
2. **Paste it into Claude Code** exactly as written
3. **Wait for Claude to complete the task** and commit to GitHub
4. **Verify the changes** by checking the files in your local directory
5. **Move to the next prompt** only after the current one is complete

### Step 3: Review Between Phases

After completing each phase (roughly every 2-3 prompts), take a moment to:
- Review the code changes in your editor
- Check that files were created correctly
- Ensure the site still runs locally (if applicable)
- Verify that changes were pushed to GitHub
